The output you provided represents two TCP connections in different states. Let's break down what each line means:

1. `tcp4 0 0 localhost.6000 localhost.50235 FIN_WAIT_2`
   - This line represents a TCP connection in the FIN_WAIT_2 state.
   - The connection is between the local system (localhost) on port 6000 and a remote system (localhost) on port 50235.
   - The FIN_WAIT_2 state occurs after the local endpoint (port 6000) has sent a TCP connection termination (FIN) signal to the remote endpoint (port 50235).
   - In this state, the local endpoint is waiting for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the remote endpoint to confirm the termination of the connection.
   - Once the ACK is received, the connection will transition to the TIME_WAIT state before fully closing.

2. `tcp4 0 0 localhost.50235 localhost.6000 CLOSE_WAIT`
   - This line represents a TCP connection in the CLOSE_WAIT state.
   - The connection is between the local system (localhost) on port 50235 and a remote system (localhost) on port 6000.
   - The CLOSE_WAIT state occurs when the local endpoint has received a TCP connection termination (FIN) signal from the remote endpoint (port 6000).
   - In this state, the local endpoint has not yet sent its own FIN signal to close the connection but is waiting for further data from the remote endpoint.
   - The CLOSE_WAIT state typically indicates that the local application has data to read from the remote endpoint but has not yet initiated the connection termination.

In summary, the output shows two TCP connections in different states:

- One connection (port 6000 to port 50235) is in the FIN_WAIT_2 state, indicating that it is waiting for an acknowledgment from the remote endpoint to complete the termination process.

- The other connection (port 50235 to port 6000) is in the CLOSE_WAIT state, indicating that the local endpoint has received a termination signal from the remote endpoint but is still waiting for further data before initiating its own connection termination.
